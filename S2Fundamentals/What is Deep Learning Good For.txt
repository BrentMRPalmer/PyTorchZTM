What is Deep Learning Good For?

1) Problems with long lists of rules - when the traditional approach
	fails, machine learning/deep learning may help.
2) Continually changing environments - deep learning can adapt ('learn')
	to new scenarios.
3) Discovering insights within large collections of data - can you
	imagine trying to hand-craft rules for what 101 different 
	kinds of food look like?

What deep learning is (typically) not good for

1) When you need explainability - the patterns learned by a deep
	learning model are typically uninterpretable by a human.
2) When the traditional approach is a better option - if you can
	accomplish what you need with a simple rule-based system.
3) When errors are unacceptable - since the outputs of a deep 
	learning model aren't always predictable.
4) When you don't have much data - deep learning models usually 
	require a fairly large amount of data to produce great 
	results.
