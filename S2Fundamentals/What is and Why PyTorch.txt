What is and Why PyTorch?

What is PyTorch?
- Most popular research deep learning framework
- Write fast deep learning code in Python (Able to run on a GPU / many GPUs)
- Able to access many pre-built deep learning models (Torch Hub/torchvision.models)
- Whole stack: preprocess data, model data, deploy model in your application/cloud
- Originally designed and used in-house by Facebook/Meta (now open-source and used 
	by companies such as Tesla, Microsoft, OpenAI)

Why PyTorch
- Research favourite
- Can solve very sophisticated problems
- Used in lots of places in industry (ex: Tesla using it for autopilot)

What is a GPU/TPU?
A GPU is a graphics processing unit (requires a lot of numerical computations)
GPU uses CUDA that allows you to run machine learning code on GPUs.

A TPU is a tensor processing unit (not very common)
Machine learning and deep learning deals a lot with tensors, so this is useful.
