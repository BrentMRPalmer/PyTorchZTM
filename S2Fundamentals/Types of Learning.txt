Types of Learning

Supervised Learning
When you have data and labels
When you have precise examples of outputs based on inputs
ex: a bunch of photos of cats and dogs that are labeled as 
cats and dogs

Unsupervised and Self-supervised Learning
You just have the data itself - you don't have any labels
Learns solely on the data itself
ex: the same photos without any labels

Transfer Learning
Taking the patterns that one model has learned and
transferring it to another model
ex: taking a model that has already learned other animals
to get a head start on the cat and dog model

We will be focusing on supervised learning and transfer learning.
This style of code can be adapted to other paradigms.

Reinforcement learning
The idea that you have an agent and an environment.
You reward certain desirable actions of the agent.
