What are Neural Networks?

1) Inputs (unstructured data)
2) Numerical encoding (converting input data into numbers)
3) Learns representation (patterns/features/weights) (choose the appropriate neural network for your problem)
4) Representation outputs (outputs in numerical format)
5) Human understandable outputs (numerical format decoded)

Input layer -> various hidden layers -> output layer
CNN stands for convolutional neural network

Anatomy of Neural Networks
1) Input layer (data goes in here)
2) Hidden layer(s) (learns patterns in data)
3) Output layer (outputs 

The overall architecture refers to all of the layers combined.
Note: "patterns" is an arbitrary term, you'll often hear "embedding,
"weights," "feature representation,"feature vectors" all referring to
similar things.

Each layer is usually a combination of linear (straight line) and/or 
non-linear (not-straight line) functions.
