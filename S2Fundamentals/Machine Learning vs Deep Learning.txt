Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning

Use traditional machine learning data on structured data 
Structured data: labeled data, like a spreadsheet with columns and rows
Algorithm: Gradient boosted machine

Use deep learning on unstructured data
Data that is all over the place (like natural language)
Algorithm: Neural network


Common algorithms for machine learning
1) Random forest
2) Gradient boosted models
3) Naive Bayes
4) Nearest neighbour
5) Support vector machine
Since the advent of deep learning, these are often referred to 
as "shallow algorithms"

Common algorithms for deep learning
1) Neural networks
2) Fully connected neural network
3) Convolutional neural network
4) Recurrent neural network
5) Transformer

Depending on how you represent your problem, you can probably
use algorithms from both lists.
