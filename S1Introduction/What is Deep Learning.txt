Course Welcome and What is Deep Learning?

What is deep learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning.

Machine learning is turning things (data) into numbers and finding
patterns in those numbers. 

The computer finds the pattterns using code and math.
This course is code focused, not on the math.

Traditional Programming:
Start with rules and inputs.
The rules are followed to create the output.

Machine Learning Algorithm:
Start with the inputs and outputs.
The computer determines the rules which can be 
applied to new inputs.
> Figures out the bridge between the input to the output
